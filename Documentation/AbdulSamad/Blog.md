### About Me: Abdul Samad Siddiqui ðŸ™Œ 
Hey Folks!  I'm Abdul Samad Siddiqui ðŸ‘‹, currently a second-year undergraduate software engineering student at Usman Institute of Technology. With two years of experience, I've been actively contributing to various open-source projects for a year. As a dedicated open-source advocate, I've organized numerous workshops on my campus to foster enthusiasm for open-source initiatives. In 2023, I had the privilege of becoming an LFX Mentee in the Open Mainframe Projects. My project centered around the Zowe-Python-SDK.

### What is Zowe-Python-SDK ðŸš€:
Zowe is an integrated and extensible open-source framework for z/OS. Similar to popular operating systems like macOS and Windows, Zowe offers a core set of applications combined with APIs and OS capabilities. These components pave the way for future applications to be built upon. Zowe provides modern interfaces to interact with z/OS, allowing a cloud-platform-like experience. The Zowe-Python-SDK specifically enables the creation of client applications and scripts that interface with z/OS REST API interfaces. This SDK empowers Python developers to craft powerful applications for interacting with z/OS components.

### My role as Summer Mentee ðŸŒž:
During my time as a Linux Foundation Mentee, I focused on enhancing the Zowe project. Specifically, I worked on finalizing team configuration support and other enhancements to facilitate a v2 release. This included adding support for Zowe v2 team configuration. I tackled various issues, such as:

- Load secure values from multiple credential entries on Windows (#134)
- [core] Save secure profile properties to a vault (#72)
- [core] Save profile properties to the zowe.config.json file (#73)
- [zos-files] list_dsn should have an option to return attributes (#117)
- [zos-files] Add a method to copy a data set or member (#63)

These tasks demanded a blend of Python, REST API, and analytical skills. Throughout this journey, I had the incredible opportunity to be mentored by Timothy Johnson and Fernando Rijo Cedeno. Weekly sync-up calls enabled us to discuss progress, challenges, and solutions, which greatly enriched my experience.

### Challenges as a Mentee ðŸ¤”:
Although I've been fortunate to receive unwavering support from my mentors, I did encounter challenges, particularly when working on the issue of loading secure values from multiple credential entries on Windows (#134). This challenge arose due to the distinct behavior of the keyring library in Python on Windows compared to other Zowe frameworks like NodeJs and Zowe-CLI. However, with the consistent guidance and encouragement of my mentors, we successfully navigated this hurdle and achieved our objectives.

### Wrapping Up: A Journey of Gratitude and Growth ðŸŒ±
In conclusion, I express my heartfelt gratitude to my mentors and the Linux Foundation for providing me with this enriching opportunity. The experience of contributing to the Zowe project and collaborating with exceptional mentors has been invaluable, fostering both personal and professional growth.
